## Just Like Rays

A mod that overhaul minecraft block light engine to behave more like real light with the power of FBGBV\*! (so for example, walls will cast shadows)

This mod is in alpha. Core content is there but there be dragons! (and edge cases)

\*yes its a real name, it mean Face Based GBV :)

##### Todo/Roadmap:

- tweaking mc border chunk system to fix ranges above 15
- settings (radius, intensity, etc)

##### Maybe/Far future:

- par face light level data instead of per block (1 block large corridors would look much better)
- tweaking the renderer to make use of the additionnal light level data
- RGB light
- further paralelization of the GBV algorithm
